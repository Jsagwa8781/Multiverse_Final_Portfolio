### Weather Application

#### Situation
**Rationale:** Our cohort created this app to practice working with third-party APIs and developing dynamic frontend applications.

**Problem:** We aimed to provide users with easy access to current weather information and forecasts for various locations.

#### Task
**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React
- Styling: CSS
- Version Control: Git

**Rationale:** We chose React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering, which is ideal for displaying dynamic weather data.

**Design and Architecture:** The app follows a single-page application design, with components for current weather, forecasts, and location search.

**Ways of Working:** We utilized GitHub Projects for planning and task assignments. This tool allowed us to create and manage issues, track progress, and collaborate effectively. We used Git for version control, creating branches for different features and using pull requests for code review before merging. Our workflow involved regular team check-ins to discuss progress and address any blockers.

#### Action
**Impact:** My contributions included:
- Researching and integrating a suitable weather API
- Developing components for displaying weather information
- Implementing the location search functionality

**Challenges:**
- We faced difficulties finding free weather APIs with comprehensive data.
- **Solution:** We compared multiple APIs and chose one that offered the best balance of features and cost-effectiveness, while also implementing error handling for potential API limitations.

#### Result
**Overview:** The completed app allows users to view current weather and forecasts for their location and search for weather information in other areas.

**Evaluation:** The application successfully provides users with accurate and up-to-date weather information, meeting its primary objective.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The importance of thorough API research and evaluation before integration
- The value of error handling and fallback options when working with external data sources
- The need for responsive design to ensure usability across different devices

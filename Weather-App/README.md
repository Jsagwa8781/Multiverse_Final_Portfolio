# Weather Application

## High-Level Overview

### Purpose
The Weather Application provides users with real-time weather information for their current location and various global locations. It offers a comprehensive overview of weather conditions, including temperature (in both Fahrenheit and Celsius), humidity, daily high and low temperatures, and wind speed.

### Users
- **Local Users:** Individuals checking the current weather and forecast for their location.
- **Travelers:** People needing weather updates for various destinations around the world.
- **Weather Enthusiasts:** Users exploring weather data for different global locations.

### Function
The primary function of the Weather Application is to deliver accurate and up-to-date weather information. The app presents essential weather metrics and forecasts in an intuitive user interface, allowing users to plan their activities and travels effectively.

### Inspiration
The project was inspired by the need to practice front-end development skills while working with real-time data from an API. A weather app was chosen as it allowed the team to learn how to integrate third-party APIs, handle asynchronous data fetching, and design an interactive user interface.

### Key Features
- **Local Weather Display:** Shows the current weather, temperature, humidity, daily high and low temperatures, and wind speed for the user's location.
- **Weather Forecast:** Provides a 2-day weather forecast, including temperature and weather conditions.
- **Random Location Weather:** Allows users to view weather information for a random location by selecting the "location marker" image.
- **Temperature Units:** Offers temperature readings in both Fahrenheit and Celsius for user preference.

## STAR Interview Questions

### Situation
Our team decided to create a Weather Application to practice developing a front-end application using data from a live API. The goal was to build a weather app that could track and display weather and location data in real-time.

### Task
The task involved creating an application that allows users to view current weather details and forecasts for their location. Additionally, the app needed to provide weather information for random global locations and display temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.

### Action
1. **API Integration:**
   - Conducted research to find a suitable API that met our requirements.
   - Tested various APIs to ensure they provided the necessary weather information without hidden fees.

2. **Project Planning and Design:**
   - Divided tasks among team members to ensure an efficient workflow.
   - Designed a single-page React application to display dynamic weather information.

3. **Development:**
   - Integrated the selected API with the back-end to fetch real-time weather data.
   - Developed a basic UI to display the weather information.
   - Enhanced the UI to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing experience.

### Result
The completed Weather Application allows users to view their local weather details and explore weather information for random locations. The app features an intuitive interface that effectively displays current weather conditions and forecasts.

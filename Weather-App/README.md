## Front End Project - Weather App
### High-level overview of the project purpose
This application is a weather app where users can see their weather local current weather and forecast as well as global locations. The app also displays some other details such as the temperature in farenheit and celsius, humidity, that day's high and low temperature and wind speed.

### Situation
My Team decided to create this project to pratice our skills in creating a front end application using information provided by an API. The application is a basic weather app that uses a third party live API to track weather and location data.

### Task
When opening our app, the browser will prompt you to allow "location sharing". If allowed the main page will display. This is a paage that shows the name of your approximate location, the wether asnd temperature, the days humidity and high an dlow temperature as well as wind speeds. Below this you can also find the forecast for temperature and weather for the next 2 days. We have also added functinality to see a random locations weather data. When the user selcts the "location marker" image, a random location is chosen from the API and then the same info that shows for yur local location is displayed for the random location.

### Action
When designing this application, we looked for a proper API that would provide all the information we wanted to display within our app. It took some time and trial and error to figure out APIs that accomplished this goal without hidden fees. Once we found it, we began assigning tasks for who would create what and what parts we woud be in charge of. We decided on a basic one page react app that could display dynamically. We began with backend tasks first, connecting out API to the code. Then we created basic UI display to test that the needed information would show up. Once we neew we could diplay our API info, we designed more complex designs to create the site that is pictured in the results section.

### Result
As a result, users of this application can navigate to our site and view theirs location's weather details and also select a button to view a random location's weather information.

### 1. Personal Budget Tracker

#### Situation
**Rationale:** I created this app to address the need for a simple, yet effective personal finance management tool. Many existing solutions were either too complex or lacked essential features for everyday budgeting.

**Problem:** The problem I aimed to solve was the difficulty many individuals face in tracking their income and expenses efficiently, leading to poor financial management and decision-making.

#### Task
**Tech Stack:**
- Language: Python
- Framework: Streamlit
- Libraries: Plotly, Pandas
- Version Control: Git

**Rationale:** I chose this tech stack because:
- Python is versatile and has a rich ecosystem for data manipulation and visualization.
- Streamlit allows for rapid development of data-centric web applications.
- Plotly provides interactive and customizable charts.

**Design and Architecture:** The app follows a simple, single-page design with input forms for income and expenses, and visualizations for financial data.

**Ways of Working:** As an individual project, I used Git for version control and followed an iterative development process, regularly testing and refining features.

#### Action
**Impact:** I was solely responsible for all aspects of the project, from conception to implementation. My contributions included:
- Designing the user interface
- Implementing data input functionality
- Creating visualizations for financial data
- Ensuring the app was user-friendly and intuitive

**Challenges:**
- The main challenge was the inability to create a database, which forced me to hardcode many elements.
- **Solution:** I used Streamlit's session state to store temporary data and implemented file-based storage for persistence between sessions.

#### Result
**Overview:** The completed app allows users to input their income and expenses, view summary statistics, and see visual representations of their financial data through pie charts.

**Evaluation:** The app successfully fulfills its purpose of providing a simple tool for personal budget tracking. However, the lack of a proper database limits its scalability and long-term data storage capabilities.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The importance of planning for data persistence from the project's outset
- The value of user feedback in refining the interface and functionality
- The need to balance feature implementation with project constraints

#### Competencies
- **JF 2.1:** Created user stories and requirements for the budget tracking app.
- **JF 3.4:** Developed a logical and maintainable codebase in Python.
- **JF 4.6:** Implemented unit testing to ensure the accuracy of financial calculations.

Personal Budget Tracker
Project Overview
Purpose
The Personal Budget Tracker is a comprehensive tool designed to help users efficiently manage their finances. By tracking various sources of income and categories of expenses, users can gain a clear understanding of their financial situation. This application aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for data entry, powerful visualizations for financial insights, and summary metrics to help users make informed financial decisions.

Users
Individuals: This tool is ideal for anyone looking to gain better control over their personal finances. Whether you're saving for a major purchase, trying to stick to a budget, or simply want to understand where your money is going, this application is designed to meet your needs.
Financial Advisors: Professionals who assist clients with budgeting and financial planning can use this tool to create detailed financial overviews and provide actionable advice.
Job
The primary function of the Personal Budget Tracker is to enable users to keep track of their financial inflows (incomes) and outflows (expenses). By providing a structured format for data entry and generating insightful visualizations, the application helps users understand their spending habits, identify areas for savings, and plan for future expenses.

Inspiration
The inspiration for this project came from a personal need for a simple, yet powerful budgeting tool. Existing solutions in the market are often either too complex for everyday use or come with a steep learning curve. My goal was to create an application that combines ease of use with essential budgeting features, making financial management accessible to everyone.

Key Features
Data Entry: Users can input various types of incomes (e.g., salary, side hustle, other income) and expenses (e.g., rent, utilities, groceries, car, other expenses, savings) through a simple and intuitive interface.
Visualization: The application generates pie charts for both income and expense breakdowns, providing a visual representation of the financial data.
Summary Metrics: The tool calculates and displays total income, total expenses, and remaining budget, helping users quickly assess their financial status.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, ensuring that users can easily navigate and utilize the application.

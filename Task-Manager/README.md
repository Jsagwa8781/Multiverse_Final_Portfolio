### Task Manager Application

#### Situation
**Rationale:** Our cohort developed this application to practice creating a secure, authenticated task management system.

**Problem:** We aimed to create a solution for users to manage their tasks efficiently while ensuring data privacy and security.

#### Task
**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Authentication: JWT, bcrypt
- Version Control: Git

**Rationale:** We focused on backend technologies to prioritize functionality and security over frontend design, given the time constraints.

**Design and Architecture:** We implemented a RESTful API design with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Ways of Working:** We utilized GitHub Projects for planning and task assignments. This tool allowed us to create and manage issues, track progress, and collaborate effectively. We used Git for version control, creating branches for different features and using pull requests for code review before merging. Our workflow involved regular team check-ins to discuss progress and address any blockers.

#### Action
**Impact:** My primary contributions included:
- Implementing the authentication system using JWT
- Developing API routes for task CRUD operations
- Ensuring proper authorization checks for data access

**Challenges:**
- We found it too time-consuming to create a proper frontend within the project timeframe.
- **Solution:** We focused on creating a robust backend API with comprehensive documentation, allowing for future frontend development.

#### Result
**Overview:** The completed application provides a secure backend for task management, including user authentication and authorization.

**Evaluation:** While the lack of a frontend limits immediate usability, the backend successfully fulfills its purpose of providing secure task management functionality.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The importance of scope management in project planning
- The value of focusing on core functionality when faced with time constraints
- The significance of thorough API documentation for future development

#### Competencies
- **JF 3.7:** Implemented authentication and authorization for the API.
- **JF 3.8:** Encrypted sensitive data via hashing for user passwords.
- **JF 4.2:** Ensured the protection of personal data through secure coding practices.
- **JF 6.4:** Worked independently and took responsibility for critical backend features.
- **JF 6.2:** Followed team approaches to version control and project management using GitHub.
